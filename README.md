# WeatherForecast
A simple script that checks the weather for today.

I was inspired to make this script as part of a goal to learn web scraping in python, in addition to doing this as a challenge in LHD Build.

Code is 100% written in python, web scraping provided by the BeautifulSoup4 and requests libraries.

A simple command line/IDE-based script, usage instructions are simple. Run weather.py, and when prompted, type in the name of the city you want to check the weather for. 
The program will then return the current weather conditions and current temperature.
